# Totem-Parallax
Simple mouse and device orientation tracking effect, inspired from Parallax.js (http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/)

## Installation
Just download totem_parallax.js, import it in your project and you are done.

## HOW TO USE IT
4 'modes' are possible:

1- simple mouse tracking with different intensities, use the attribute <code>data-totmov=""</code> on any div you want to move

2- only x movement, use the attribute <code>data-totmovx=""</code> on any div you want to move

3- only y movement, use the attribute <code>data-totmovy=""</code> on any div you want to move

4- different intensities for x movement and y movement, use the attributes <code>data-totmovx=""</code> and <code>data-totmovy=""</code> on any div you want to move

## TIPS
To make the div go in the other direction just put a negative value
